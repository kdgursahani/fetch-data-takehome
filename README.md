## Fetch Data Engineering Take-Home Assessment ##
This application is designed to process user login behavior data from an AWS SQS queue, mask sensitive information, and store the results in a Postgres database. The application uses Docker containers for local development and testing, and is currently designed for local testing and deployment. This document consists of the pre-requisites for this application to run successfully locally, steps to run this application, and answers questions pertaining to selecting the right deployment tools, addressing potential challenges, and ensuring that the deployment aligns with organizational policies and best practices.

This project is the solution for the Data Engineering assignment given in the below link:

## Pre-requisites ##
Installation of Docker, docker-compose, awscli-local, and psql.

## Steps to run the application ##

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdgursahani/fetch-data-takehome.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository folder, and run the command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
3. Navigate to the src folder within the repository, and run the code to test local access:
```bash
python ./sqs_read_mask.py "http://localhost:4566/000000000000/login-queue"
```
4. Navigate to the repository folder, and run the following command to stop the container, once data has been written to Postgres successfully:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
